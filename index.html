         <h1>Hi, I'm Cory</h1>
         <h2>Colorado Local, Avid Skier, Daschund Owner</h2>
         <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>Iâ€™m a newer UX/UI designer with a unique blend of experiences. I hold a degree in psychology, which, combined with my background in mortgage sales, has shaped my journey into the world of user experience and user interface design.</p>
         <h3>Why UX/UI?</h3>
            <p>My psychology background has given me a deep understanding of human behavior, cognition, and the intricacies of decision-making. It has taught me to approach design challenges with empathy, considering the emotional and psychological aspects of user interactions. Having spent several years in mortgage sales, I intimately understood the importance of user-friendly interfaces and seamless experiences in the financial sector.</p>
         <h3>Bridging Worlds</h3>
            <p>My transition from psychology to mortgage sales to UX/UI design may seem unconventional, but it's this unique perspective that sets me apart. I bring a deep understanding of client needs, empathy for end-users, and a knack for simplifying complex processes. My goal is to create intuitive, aesthetically pleasing interfaces that not only meet business objectives but also enrich the lives of those who interact with them.</p>
